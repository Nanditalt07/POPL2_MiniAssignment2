# Mini Assignment 2: Large Code Bases and OOP
 
 
# C++ Features Used
 
## Rich Libraries
 
Both C++ and Clang are rich library-based architectures. This is a good way to ensure cleanly divided functions so that the developer can access a wide range of functionality with a mix and match using all the libraries.
 
 
## Machine Independence / Portability
 
Portability refers to the use of the same code but in different environments. C++ code is highly portable making this a remarkable feature of C++ and likewise is that of LLVM. LLVM code is highly portable in Unix-like operating systems and also has great support in Windows.
 
 
## Speed
 
C++ is comparatively faster than other programming languages like Java and Python. In the low-level reason being, C++ is a compiler-based language whereas the other 2 are interpreter-based. But, the feature common to C++ and LLVM is that they have a library that makes the time easier for time calculation.
 
 
## Scalability 
 
Both C++ and LVVM are scalable and capable of running on both large and small scales of data. LLVM is fast and light as well which makes it easily scalable.
 
## Syntax Based
 
C++ is a language that is highly dependent on syntax and if anything wrong there is an error from the compiler. Similarly, in LLVM each instruction has a specific syntax to be followed.

## Features of C++11/C++14
----------------------------
 
The functionality of various features from the latest versions of C++ also are available as a part of LLVM. Below are a few popular additions as a part of these versions present in LLVM. 
 
## Lambda Expressions
 
Lambda Expressions are for writing shorter codes that are not going to be reused and hence naming is not required making it anonymous. This feature was introduced in C++11 and also is a part of LLVM as `clang::LambdaExpr` Class Reference.
 
## nullptr
C++11 has introduced nullptr which can be used as a replacement for the bug-prone NULL and 0. nullptr converts implicitly and hence can be compared to any pointer type. This exists as a part of LLVM as `
llvm::ConstantPointerNull`
 
## r-value References
r-value refers to the value of the data at a particular memory location. RValue in LLVM is used to represent the result of an expression that has finished its evaluation. It is part of the `clang::CodeGen::RValue` Class Reference.

# Class Hierarchy
 
All the core classes that define and represent the LLVM code are part of the `include/llvm/IR` directory. Class hierarchy identifying the object as a class’s instantiations. Similar to C++ wherein the hierarchical inheritance of various classes can be derived from a single base class. 
<br/>
For example, the type class has `Type` as a superclass for all type classes. As for the Type class, it cannot be instantiated directly but can only be used through its derived classes. These derived classes may have further subclasses but tend to be hidden due to less functionality from the user’s end. Every value has a type. Examples include the `IntegerType`. Here the subclasses are based on the bit width. Similarly, the SequentialType, ArrayType, PointerType, VectorType, StructType, FunctionType are a few.
 
Here we can say that the Type class is at the top of the inheritance tree, the DerivedTypes come next, and then the Subclasses of the derived types.
 
Inheritance Tree Example: (Taking FunctionType as the DerivedType)
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FunctionType <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \ <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \ <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isVarArg()&nbsp;&nbsp;\ <br/>
getReturnType() &nbsp; getParamType(unsigned i)

# Design Patterns
 
Looking into the design of Clang, like other compilers, it has 3 phases<br/>
(i) Front End <br/>
(ii) Optimizer <br/>
(iii) Back End <br/>
 
Source Code -> FrontEnd -> Common Optimizer -> Backend -> Machine Code <br/>
 
Clang is based upon LLVM which works on the basis of generating an LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR). LLVM IR does a little transformation and analysis as in the optimizer section of compilers.
 
<br/>
 
 
## Design Features : 

The following are a few features evidently visible in the design of the CLang/LLVM codebase
<br/>
 
## **Modularity :**
 
### Modularity using Libraries
The library-based architecture is a significant design feature that allows for a clean front-end where all these libraries can be permuted and used based on the required functionality. 
 
### Modularity using namespaces
- Namespaces containing only enums <br/>
Work similar to enum classes in C++ which overcome the conflict where different enums named the same as their values scoped within the enum's name.
- Anonymous namespace <br/>
Will be available only in the file they are created.
 
<br/>
 
 
## **Paradigm Usage :**
 
### Procedural Paradigm
- Global Functions
  - Utility  functions : Often reused common functions
  - Operators
  - Functions related to the Compiler Logic
 
- Static Global Functions
- Global functions better as a static <br/>
 Functions that fall in the above categories but not declared to be static are better off if declared static and they comprise this category
 
### Object Oriented paradigm 
( Discussed in the next section in detail)
 
- Inheritance
  - Multiple Inheritance
- Virtual methods
 
 
### Generic Programming
There are many generic Types but very few generic Methods
 
<br/>
 
 
## **Implementation Quality:**
- Method Size : Not very big ensuring easy readability
- Number of Parameters : Very few functions with more than 7 parameters in my observation
- Number of Local Variables : The number of local variables is not huge in all the functions
- Complexity overall seems to be the optimized and efficient code is seen
 
 
 
<br/>

# OOP Design Decisions for LLVM
 
Various significant OOP concepts are present in the Code base of LLVM/Clang the basic but prominent among them include the following.
 
- ## Classes
Classes comprise as the core component in an OOP design. The LLVM IR interprets these classes as structs associated with various functions and methods.
 
- ## Inheritance 
This is how class hierarchy comes into the picture. Various classes inherit from one another forming a connection ( as seen in the hierarchy tree) between the objects. When various classes inherit from a common class, this is called the base class. The LLVM IR places all the classes in the respective order in the memory.
 
### Multiple Inheritance
This is the phenomenon where a class is inherited from more than one parent class. In the LLVM code base this is very rarely observed.
 
- ## Virtual Methods 
Virtual Methods are also seen in the LVVM code base where a function is declared in its base class but overridden by a DerivedClass.
 
- ## Interfaces
A base class with no attributes and only virtual methods is known as an Interface.
 
- ## `new` Operator
 
 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 
 
# Usage of iterators and their own data structures
 
## Iterators
Though the pattern is common there are various iterators, or forms of iterators to be more precise, used to transverse across the data structures and instructions in LLVM.
 
- `InstInterator` is used for going through the BasicBlock of a function
- Fallible iterator supporting Iteration through Falling Containers
- Iterator as a pointer to a class : Getting a reference from an iterator is just accessing it directly with an arrow as we do in pointers. The speciality with iterators in LVVM is that they from pointer to instance type automatically when required. 
 
## Data Structures of LLVM
 
There are plenty of Data Structures as a part of LLVM which can be found in the `llvm/ADT/` directory.<br/>
The data structures can be broadly classified into the following categories initially depending on what type of functionality is required and then further the specifics will enable for choosing the precise structure for the task. <br/>
 
Containers that can be chosen:
 
(i) `Map-Like` Container : If there is key and value type of correspondance <br/>
(ii) `Set-Like` Container: If duplicates are not to be entertained in the entries <br/>
(iii) `Sequential` Container : If the order of the adding of elements is of main importance. <br/>
(iv) `string` Container : Sequential Container of characters <br/>
(v) `bit` Container : Efficient method to store the element in a maximum of 1 byte and perform operations on sets of numeric IDs. 
 
 
<br/>
<br/>

 
In conclusion, there are numerous features to the Clang/LLVM Code Base with rich OOP concepts and C++ features embedded and hence seen as an efficient open source compiler still being made better and optimized.
